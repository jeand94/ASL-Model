# ASL-Model
Predict ASL hands gestures using machine learning 

# Steps to run 
If you are wanting to test and use this model, you must follow the steps outlined below. 
1. Download the kaggle dataset at the address below and place it 
within the root directory of this repository. 
2.) You must install all dependencies for this project. Some of them are outlined below
  * Tensorflow
  * OpenCV
  * NumPy
  * Keras
  * sklearn
  * HandDector 


3.) One you have all of that you may execute the program. 

Please note that this is CPU intensive and you should be sure you have capacity to run such a model. It
took over 10 hours to train. In the case you dont want to train the model. You can use the H5 file, which
is the binary of the trained model. That can be used to execute the model directly without training.
